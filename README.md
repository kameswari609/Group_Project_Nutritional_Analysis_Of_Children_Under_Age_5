## Project Description/Preliminary Outline
	
India is a very diverse and unique county with over a billion inhabitants.  The scope of this project will cover one of the most controversial topics in the region, nutrition in children. Children are the future of every civilization and their development will define the success or failure of future societies. The main concept of the project will be to analyze the variables that compose nutritional development in children under the age of 5 years; surveyed in year 2013(NFHS3) and 2015-2016(NFHS4) The project will provide analysis of Urban Vs Rural Nutritional comparison for Survey (NFHS4). Also ,will provide the comparative analysis between the 2 surveys all over Indian States over time. 

In conclusion, we believe we can paint a picture on how nutrition varies across India States in children under the age of five and get comprehension backed by data.

## Datasets to Be Used

## Indicators 

1. NFHS3 (Well Fed Vs Under Fed) Ratio

3. NFHS3 Vs NFHS4 -Female Child (per 1000 male) Percent change
4. Top 5 & Below 5 States For UnderFed & Well Fed in both Surveys

## Nutritional Analysis Conclusions
1. Breastfeeding Exclusively for the first six months has no correlation to stunted growth %

2. Gender ratio:-  Dadar and Nagar Haveli have highest rural (1308) and urban is lowest among all states

3. Under Fed To Well Fed Ratio has decreased by 60% over the years the 2 surveys were conducted.

4. Female child(per 1000 males) birth has increased by 27%

5. The National Family & Health Survey positively shows the nutritional improvement efforts taken by the govt to provide   post pregnancy education, medical health & food supplies are on track to make rural to urban ratio insignificant.

6. Work done by  foundations like Cry America , Akshaya Patra, Sankara Eye Foundation , etcâ€¦.who have diligent workers in villages trying to curb the malnutrition of kids. Donations to them can be done by amazon smile.

## limitations
1. There is no Rural & Urban separate data set for NFHS3 survey(2013)

2.Data Numbers were somewhat inconsistent.

3.India is vast, so the data that is published talks to significant Rural and Urban Areas thus does not include many other smaller villages and territories. 

4.Data also does not talk about the measures that were taken between the two surveys to improve the nutritional health of the population in question.
