## Project Description/Preliminary Outline
	
India is a very diverse and unique county with over a billion inhabitants.  The scope of this project will cover one of the most controversial topics in the region, nutrition in children. Children are the future of every civilization and their development will define the success or failure of future societies. The main concept of the project will be to analyze the variables that compose nutritional development in children under the age of 5 years. The project will compare and contrast different India Stateâ€™s childhood augmentations across a variety of macro-variables such as a poor state vs. a rich state or a low population vs. a high population. Additionally, this project will accrue insights into how children with adequate nutrition compare to children with poor nutrition. Down below are the main questions we want to tackle in this data analysis but more topics may also arise as research continues. In conclusion, we believe we can paint a picture on how nutrition varies across India States in children under the age of five and get comprehension backed by data.
